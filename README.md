An auto manufacturer would like to leverage summary statistics and statistical testing improve the manufacturing process and to inform decisions for a new product lineup.


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

With multivariate regression the most statistically significant variables impacting miles per gallon are vehicle length and ground clearance.  With the intercept at -104 and statistically significant we can also assume the slope of the line is not 0 and that we have opportunity to better define the independent variables driving mpg.  Although there could be some overfitting with variables like spoiler_angle that are not statistically signficant, the strong r-sqare value of 0.71 and a signficant p-value indicates that the model is able to explain much of the mpg variance between vehicles with the selected independent variables.
